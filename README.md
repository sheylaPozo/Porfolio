The main purpose of the project [Portfolio](https://sheylapozo.github.io/Porfolio/) was for me to develop some hands on work as a code reviewer, using my previous knokledge working with Html, CSS, and linters, which also serves as practice in documenting my work in a professional way, with the learning objectives of using the best practices in HTML code, semantic HTML tags, CSS selectors in a correct way, CSS box model, and to perform a code review for myself on a past project for experience.
