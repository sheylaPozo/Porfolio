The main purpose of the project [Portfolio](https://sheylapozo.github.io/Porfolio/) was for me to develop some hands-on work using my previous knowledge working with Html, CSS, and linters, which also serves as practice in documenting my work in a professional way, with the learning objectives of using the best practices in HTML code, semantic HTML tags, CSS selectors in a correct way, CSS box model, to understand Figma designs to create a UI., using Flexbox to place elements in the page, learning how to build a personal portfolio site, as well as how to use images and backgrounds to enhance the look of the website which enhance the experience in programming with HTML and CSS.
